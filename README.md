### Overview

The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python utility designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and provide actionable feedback. It emphasizes the importance of password complexity and adherence to security standards like the **NIST SP 800-63B** guidelines, helping users understand how to create stronger, more secure passwords.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Strength Evaluation**: Checks password length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides suggestions to improve password security if deemed weak or moderate.
- **Password Entropy Calculation**: Estimates the entropy of the password to measure its resistance to guessing attacks.
- **Blacklist Validation**: Warns users if their password is too common by comparing it against a blacklist of known weak passwords.
- **Secure Input Handling**: Uses Python‚Äôs `getpass` for hidden password input to prevent password exposure.

## üîß Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional external libraries required

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-checker.git
   cd password-strength-checker
   ```

2. **Run the Password Strength Checker**:
   ```bash
   python password_strength.py
   ```

### Usage
After running the script, you will be prompted to enter a password securely. The tool will assess the strength of the password based on length, complexity, and entropy, and provide a score and feedback.

Example:

```plaintext
Enter your password: ********
Password strength: Moderate password.
Score: 3/5
Entropy: 35 bits
Suggestions to improve your password:
- Add at least one special character.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **NIST Compliance**: This tool adheres to **NIST SP 800-63B** guidelines by ensuring passwords meet minimum length requirements and encouraging longer, memorable passwords (e.g., passphrases).
- **Entropy Calculation**: The tool calculates password entropy, which measures how unpredictable a password is. A higher entropy value signifies stronger protection against brute-force attacks.
- **Blacklist Checking**: The tool checks passwords against a common list of weak passwords, providing additional protection against using easily guessable credentials.
- **Secure Input**: Passwords are securely inputted using `getpass`, ensuring they are not displayed in plaintext during entry.
- **Disclaimer**: This tool is educational and meant for local password testing. For production environments, consider more advanced security measures like password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

## üí° Future Improvements

- **Passphrase Support**: Implement functionality to assess the security of passphrases, in line with NIST recommendations for long, memorable passwords.
- **Advanced Password Policy Support**: Add customizable password policies that enforce different rules for specific applications (e.g., corporate environments).
- **Integration with MFA Systems**: Future versions could include integration with multi-factor authentication (MFA) tools to provide enhanced security.

## üîö Conclusion

The Password Strength Checker is a robust tool for evaluating the strength and security of passwords, offering real-time feedback and alignment with industry standards. By checking password complexity, calculating entropy, and preventing the use of weak passwords, it helps users create stronger and more secure credentials. This project is a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve password security, and it also serves as a foundation for further enhancements in password management and protection.
